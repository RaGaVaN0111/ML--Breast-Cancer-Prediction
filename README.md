# 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction using Random Forest

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a breast tumor is **benign (B)** or **malignant (M)** based on features computed from a digitized image of a breast mass. A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset to perform the classification.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build a predictive model to classify breast tumors.
- Explore and visualize relationships between features.
- Evaluate the model using standard metrics.
- Save and reload the trained model using `pickle`.
- Visualize important features for interpretability.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- **Attributes**: 30 numeric features (e.g., radius, texture, area, etc.)
- **Target**: Diagnosis (B = Benign, M = Malignant)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning and preprocessing
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Pickle** – Model serialization

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Load Dataset**
   - Read the dataset and remove unnecessary columns (`Unnamed: 32`, `id`).

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values using `SimpleImputer` with mean strategy.
   - Convert diagnosis labels (`B`, `M`) to binary (0, 1).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Display a heatmap to analyze feature correlations.

4. **Model Training**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a `RandomForestClassifier`.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using classification report and confusion matrix.

6. **Model Serialization**
   - Save and load the trained model using `pickle`.

7. **Feature Importance**
   - Visualize the top contributing features used by the model.

---

## 📊 Visual Outputs

- **Correlation Heatmap** – Displays relationships among features.
- **Feature Importance Chart** – Highlights the most significant features influencing predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix** – Shows true vs predicted classifications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### ▶️ Run the Script

1. Place `BreastCancer.csv` in the project folder.
2. Run the script:
```bash
python breast_cancer_prediction.py
```

 ┣ 📄BreastCancer.csv
 ┣ 📄README.md
 ┗ 📄requirements.txt
```

---

## 💾 Model Saving and Loading

The model is saved using `pickle` as `breast_cancer_model.pkl`. This allows you to reuse the trained model for future predictions without retraining.
